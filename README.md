# MatrixLibrary
Functional style glsl-like matrix library


An overengineered horror story born out of mixing templates, functional programming, glsl, and linear algebra.
I wanted to code this at least once. Other features that I had planned (but I probably won't get to implementing) 
include: holors, tensors, complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, projection matrices, arbitrary dimensional transformations.
